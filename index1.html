      <p>To enjoy reading books, you don’t need a tablet or e-reader. You can read entire books online, completely legally, in an internet browser on your computer. The most popular sites are listed below.
         The internet is the ultimate tool for finding answers and items we need. With a vast majority of products available from online stores, you don’t have to leave home to get anything that’s on your wishlist, including books, movies, games or audiobooks.
         The best thing is that you don’t have to wait for delivery. Most books are digitized and it means you can start enjoying them in a matter of seconds. It’s just a matter of finding the most convenient – and fully legal – online source of books to read.
         World’s most beloved classics are available online for free. They are the so-called public domain books. They are free because their intellectual property rights have expired, and everyone is entitled not only to download and read them but also remix and reshare.

         Institutions like Project Gutenberg or Internet Archive digitize public domain books and make them available for free through their online catalogs.
         Unless you are determined to create a stunningly large personal collection of ebooks, you don’t have to deal with copying and converting files. You can read books the moment you find them in one of the sites listed below.

         But what “read books online” means exactly? It means you won’t need any of these:
         <ol>
         <li> A dedicated device, such as a Kindle e-reader</li>
         <li> A tablet with a book reading app installed</li>
        <li> An ebook reader application on your computer</li>
          <li> An extension for your internet browser</li>
         </ol>
         All you need is a computer connected to the internet and the internet browser of your choice, such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.</p>
